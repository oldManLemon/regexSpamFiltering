# Regex filters for Email spam. 

I needed a way to filter out some obvious sex/pill/drug spam and some other more common attempts at spam.  
This is a list of regex style rules to remove some of the more egregious examples. I hope others may add this over time, as it is regex you can use it else where or that is the hope.

Oringally gathered from [here](http://barracuda.pbworks.com/w/page/13469305/FrontPage) which I thought was a bit hidden and could use updating as it last edit 9 years ago.
