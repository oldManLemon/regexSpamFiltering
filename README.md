# Regex filters for Email spam. 

I needed a way to filter out some obvious sex/pill/drug spam and some other more common attempts at spam.  
This is a list of regex style rules to remove some of the more egregious examples. I hope others may add this over time, as it is regex you can use it else where or that is the hope.

This list is for work yet conversly nsfw. Commits will reflect this as it is annoying silly problem. 

Originally gathered from [here](http://barracuda.pbworks.com/w/page/13469305/FrontPage) which I thought was a bit hidden and could use updating as it last edit 9 years ago.
